#### Underwaterfortunes website demo code for 2021 ####
This is a public repository to go with the underwaterfortunes.com site. This version has personal info and images removed.
This is a public repository with code for the site https://underwaterfortunes.com. It has personal information and security information removed. It is deployed on Heroku through a private repository on Github. The site gives random funny fortunes and uses Django, Django Rest Framework, React, Webpack 5, SCSS, Redux, Axios, useForm, useQuery, etc.

It was made using a Django backend which also included Django Rest Framework, and the frontend was made using React and Webpack 5. The frontend is served from Django.

Most of the images and static files were taken out when I uploaded this demo code.

I started the project in a Docker environment making the Django and Django Rest Framework api first. I also switched to Postgres. I then used yarn init inside of the same docker container when it was time to do the frontend. 

My other sites of interest are https://prek-eval-demo.herokuapp.com (a demo version of a site made for a client and posted with that clients permission), and monsterdreamsbook.com which is a Squarespace site for a book I wrote.
